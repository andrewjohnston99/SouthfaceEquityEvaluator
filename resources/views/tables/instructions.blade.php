           <p> The TransFormation Alliance is a broad partnership of organizations from the private, public and nonprofit sectors dedicated to creating thriving, mixed-income communities anchored by transit and linked to all the opportunities and amenities that make Atlanta great. Our mission is to offer all residents the opportunities for a high quality of life, linked by our region’s critically important transit system.</p>
           <p>Equitable TOD combines place-based and people-based approaches to develop solutions that address the needs of all residents. The result is mixed-income communities that make connections to employment opportunities, daily needs, affordable housing and employment available to everyone. Equitable TOD achieves:</p>
           <li>1. Increases in property values without displacing the residents who would most benefit from the increase</li>
           <li>2. Greater economic opportunity by creating easier access for low and moderate income households</li>
           <li>3. A balance between return on investment for private investors and equity goals</li>

              <h3>Program Verification</h3>
              <p>The Transformation Alliance Equity Evaluator Scorecard indicates the status of all items through the following columns:</p>
              <h2>Points</h2>
              <li>This indicates the numbers of points that may be earned for each item</li>
              <li>Items showing no points, or zero points, are indicated as “-“ which indicates requirements of the program	</li>
              <h2>Planned</h2>
              <li>Each equity TOD project will indicate which items they plan to achieve by inputing the items point value in this column.  Once an item is indicated with a point value, the cell will turn green to indicate the project’s intent to satisfy the item’s requirements.  If the cell turns black, it indicates that an incorrect point value has been placed in that cell;  Submitted worksheets with any black cells will not be accepted.	</li>
              <h2>Status</h2>
              <li>Yes (cell turns green) when project achieves program standards</li>
              <li>Not compliant with program standards (required cell turns red)</li>
              <li>Incorrect points entered (too low or too high)</li>
              <li>No points planned (leave cells blank rather than entering 0)</li>
